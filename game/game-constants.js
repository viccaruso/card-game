export const DECK_SIZE = 23; // in case this changes, it's better to have constants like these living in variables (usually in a separate file ). I'm just guessing with the variable names (another good reason to have constants! To give contexts for numbers floating around your app)

// is there a relationship between this number and 23? is the 23 number always 3 less than this number, i mean? probably makes sense to store this in a constant as well
export const CARD_COUNT = 26;
